	<p>
		Currently I work @ Engineering in Taghash. I like the journey solving problems because it gives me insight as to how things work 
		and predict how they are supposed to. I'm interested in reading across various genres and topics. While I don't have specific preferences, I particularly enjoy engaging stories that capture my attention.

	<p>
		Throughout this blog I want to share with you what I'm intrested in, be it; my journey of solving a particular problem, something I'm intrested in etc.
		Feedback/thoughts about what I've shared are always welcome.
		Feel free to connect with me :)
